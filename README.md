# flash_card_project
Python tkinter GUI app that makes use of pandas to read a local database as a csv file.
This project creates a nice user interface for people now learning French.
The correct button helps the user to remove learnt words or words that the user already knows.
The wrong button still adds the current word to the file, and the user can learn from it another time.
